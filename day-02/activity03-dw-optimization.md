# Activity 03: Data Warehouse Optimization

In this activity, you will work with your team to optimize the peformance of a query to make it return results in the shortest time possible. 

# Team Challenge 

WWI wants you to prove your ability to optimize queries using their data. They have provided the following query:

``` SQL
-- COMING SOON

```
You are not allowed to modify this table (in fact, **you should not modify this table** as it may affect the other labs). However, they have asked if you can create a new table and optimize the query such that it runs much faster than the **15 or so** minutes the above one takes. Working with your team, just how fast can you make this query return results?
